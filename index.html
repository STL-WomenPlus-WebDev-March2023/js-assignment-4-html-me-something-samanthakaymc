            <h2>My Outdoor Hobby</h2>
            <p>
               I have many hobbies, but one of my only outdoor hobbies is gardening. 
               I don't do well in the summer heat, so my other outdoor hobbies, hiking and walking, have to be put on the back burner.
               I started gardening this summer in 2023 because I needed to get outside before and after work, but didn't want to have to travel to do it. 
               While I am currently planting flowers, eventually I would like to plant fruits, vegetables and spices. 
               Unfortunately, I have two dogs who love to eat any food they can get their mouths on, so growing those will have to wait.

            <h3>My Front Yard</h3>
            <p>
               Thankfully, the people who lived here before me had started the gardens, but they were not maintained for the last few years. 
               To start, I planted some new lavender in my front yard, and have focused on watering the flowers that were already planted in the morning and at night.
               The flowers I have growing are hydrangeas, coneflowers, and crocus'. 
               Additionally, there are bushes and small trees that I have not yet identified.

            <h4>My Backyard</h4>
            <p>
               In the back corner of my yard, there is a walled off section that has been neglected. 
               There is a small fence running along it to keep my aforementioned dogs out (not that it works incredibly well).
               I have begun the process of clearing everything out, but unfortunately even after work it has been too hot for me to work on.
               I am currently trying to plan what will be planted so it might be able to grow this fall or next spring.
               My goal is to have a garden that I can consistently work on that also helps my local wildlife &amp; pollinators.
